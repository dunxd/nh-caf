# User stories #
These user stories are intended to give an idea how the Connectivity Assessment might be used by different people.

## Musa ##

Musa works for a Nethope member organisation, and is based in one of the field sites. He is not an ICT professional, but does have some responsibility for IT at the NGO site where he is normally based, including reporting IT problems for other staff and liaising with the local ISP.  He has been asked by the IT department for information about the site, including geolocation details.  The connection at the site is unreliable - he may not always have access to the internet.

## Belinda ##

Belinda is a regional ICT manager for a Nethope member organisation, and is based at the regional HQ for that NGO. She is responsible for IT at 10 sites in the region. Her organisation does not have IT staff at any of the sites in her region - she is directly responsible. She has been asked by her manager to collect details about internet connectivity at all her sites. She knows that some sites in her region have internet connections that fall below expectations, and would like to be able to report back which sites need more investment.

## Jessica ##

Jessica is responsible for Global Infrastructure and Connectivity in her organisation, which is a member of Nethope. She manages a team of Regional ICT Managers across three regions. She reports to the CIO.  The CIO has passed on complaints from elsewhere in the organisation that the internet connections in field sites are often too unreliable for carrying out organisational work. She has been asked to identify which sites have the worst connectivity and what is required to bring them up to standard.

## Sam ##

Sam has recently become responsible for Global IT in her organistaion, which is a member of Nethope. She has not inherited a system for tracking assets or sites. She is new to the sector and dealing with these challenges in remote locations in the global south, and would like to find out more about how colleagues in other organistaions meet the challenges. She wonders if her organisation is struggling in the same places as others, or whether there is something to be learnt from others who are doing better.

## Hans ##

Hans is the CIO of a Nethope member.  He regularly hears complaints from board members that they visited a field site and were unable to check email or make Zoom calls. One board member visited another organisation's site nearby and was able to do what she needed, and is asking why her organisation is not meeting expectations. As an active member of Nethope, Hans would like to be able to see how other Nethope members are doing in different regions and countries so he can benchmark his organisation and seek assistance from trusted peers.

## Robert ##

Robert works for Nethope.  He would like to be able to:

  - see what sort of connectivity Nethope members have at their field sites in different countries, and how well needs are being met.
  - identify countries where multiple members are struggling in order to design projects that can improve the situation. 
  - identify members that are having more success meeting their needs where others are struggling so he can help spread their knowedge. 
  - quantify overall bandwidth purchases and spend in different countries in order to more effectively lobby suppliers, donors and local regulators to reduce price, improve service or open up the market.
  - identify clusters of member sites where there may be opportunities for sharing services such as internet connectivity, electrical generation or local support services.
